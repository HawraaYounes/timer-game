# Timer Challenge App

## Overview

This project is a Timer Challenge app built using ReactJS. The main objective of this app was to learn about and effectively use refs in React. It showcases my skills in frontend development, particularly in creating dynamic user interfaces and managing state in React.

## Features

- **React Essentials**: The project demonstrates key React concepts including:
  - **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent pieces.
  - **JSX**: Using JSX syntax to structure the components.
  - **Props**: Passing data between components via props.
  - **State**: Managing component state to handle timer logic and interactions.
  - **Refs**: Using refs to control component behavior and interactions, particularly for starting, stopping, and resetting timers.
- **Timer Functionality**: Multiple timer challenges with different target times.
- **Result Modal**: Displaying results in a modal when the timer stops or reaches zero.
- **Deployed Version**: The project is deployed and accessible online. [Click here to view the deployed version](https://timer-game-one.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Used for building the frontend components and managing state.
- **Vite**: Utilized for the development build process, offering fast and optimized development experience.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the app interface.
- **Deployment**: The project is deployed using Vercel.
